### INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA DETECTION IN BREAST HISTOPATHOLOGY IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS

Breast cancer is associated with the highest cancer-related mortality rates in the world,
and it has become a serious public health concern. With 80% of occurrences, invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC) manifests as one of the most frequent forms of breast cancer.
Early detection improves the likelihood of effective therapy and survival. However, it
is a difficult and time-consuming procedure that necessitates pathologists' expertise.
Patients and their prognosis benefit greatly from the automated breast cancer detection
based on histopathological images.

The aim of this project is to implement several machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision
Tree, K Neighbors Classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural
Networks) for
improving automated detection of IDC cells in breast histopathology images.

A distinctive point of this study lies in one of the methodologies used, which is
Convolutional Neural Networks classification in histopathology images dataset. We
show that our implemented deep learning technique outperforms state-of-the-art
classification methods by a considerable margin in a series of trials.
